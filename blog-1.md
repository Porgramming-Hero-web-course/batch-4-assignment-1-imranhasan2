union type- basically union type is when we declare 2 type and combined two of them and make a new type it is union type..in union type we can use one of them we donot need two assign two type in a new variable..we have choice..
exp -
type name:string
type age:number
type person = name | age (new type)

intersection type- it is same like union but there is little different here.we have to make a new type but we have two use and operator.thats mean when we make a new variable we have to use both type.we cannot write one without them
